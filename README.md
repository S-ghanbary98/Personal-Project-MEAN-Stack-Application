# MEAN Stack Application

In this, I will create a step-by-step guide on how I deoplyed a MEAN stack application. MEAN Stack meaning:

- MongoDB (document Database) allows to store and retrieve data
- Express (Back-end framework) make request to Database 
- Angular (Front-end framework) Handles Client and Server requests
- Node.js (Javascript Runtime Env) accepts request and displaye result to user

I will be deploying this on an ec2 on aws with an 20.04 ubuntu OS, which is set up before hand.
